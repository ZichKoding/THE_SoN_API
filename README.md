# THE_SoN_API

[Click here for a walkthrough video!](https://youtube.com/)

## Description

THE_SoN_API stands for The Social Network API. With this API you are able to create users, thoughts (posts), reactions to a thought (replies), and a user can have a friend list. The database used is a NoSQL database called MongoDB, and I have used mongoose for all CRUD interactions with MongoDB.
